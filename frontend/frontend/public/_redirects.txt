# Netlify redirects configuration for React SPA
# This file ensures all routes are handled by React Router

# Redirect all requests to index.html for client-side routing
# The 200 status code means "rewrite" (not redirect), so the URL stays the same
/*    /index.html   200

# Note: If you have specific API routes or assets, add them above this rule
# Example:
# /api/*  https://your-backend-api.com/api/:splat  200
